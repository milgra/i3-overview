# Zen Music test protocol

Before creating a pull request make sure that no memory leaks are present in the code, you will see leaks in the standard output after running a development build generated by the built-in zc_memory handler and clang's address sanitizer. ( Note : SDL has two 40 byte length internal leaks, those doesn't count as leaks )
Then create a release build with make rel.
Then run all test sessions with make runtest, that will test the overview renderer with the input/output files under /tst.
